# Spam-SMS-Detection
The primary objective of this project is to develop a Spam SMS Detection System using machine learning algorithms that can automatically distinguish between spam and legitimate messages. This project focuses on building a machine learning model that can classify SMS messages as “Spam” or “Ham” (non-spam) using Natural L (NLP) techniques.
